My project is a MEHN stack organizer: it takes info its given and helps create and organize the file system for its users. 
It has users so you can keep track of your projects, prevents you from adding stuff, and towards the gold end of things, 
it's supposed to suggest file placements based on the models you've entered into the system.

Models:
Users{
    Username:
    Password:
}

Project{
    Name:
    Folder{
        Name:
    }
    Files{
        Name:
    }
}

Models{
    Name:
    Key Value Pair{
        Name:
        Value:
    }
    Methods{
        Name:
        Function:
    }
}
